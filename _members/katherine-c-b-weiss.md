## Bio

Katherine (Kate) Weiss is a PhD student at Arizona State University and an urban wildlife ecologist. Her work seeks to understand urbanization's impact on mammal communities, species interactions, and human-wildlife conflict using mixed methods, including functional trait approaches. 

## Collaboration Statement

I can offer expertise in vertebrate, wildlife, and urban ecological perspectives. I can also provide support when thinking about how to conduct cross-taxa comparisons, how to apply functional ecological work to conservation and management, as well as help with manuscript writing and copy-editing.
